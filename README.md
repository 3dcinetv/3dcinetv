My name is Pierre Schiller, I am a 3D Animator & VFX Compositor with 20+ years of experience in commercial advertisement, videogames, and VFX for cinema using a variety of software including Softimage, After Effects, Lustre, Flame, among others.

Iâ€™ve also worked as a Blender Foundation Certified Trainer in the last 4 years doing live and online workshops about sculpting, 2d grease pencil animation, and 3D experiences with 360Âº, AR, and VR for Snapchat and Spark lens filters using Blender.

Check my <a href="https://3dcinetv.com/blog"><strong>BLOG</strong></a> for more information about how I integrate Blender and other software for 2D and 3D workflows.
